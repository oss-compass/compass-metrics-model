The Moby Project
================

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png "The Moby Project")

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a "Lego set" of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set it
It is your responsibility to ensure that your use and/or transfer does not
violate applicable laws.
