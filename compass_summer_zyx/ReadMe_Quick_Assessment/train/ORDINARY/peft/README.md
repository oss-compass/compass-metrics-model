Quantization is another method for reducing the memory requirements of a model by representing the data in a lower precision. It can be combined with PEFT methods to make it even easier to train and load LLMs for inference.

* Learn how to finetune a [openai/whisper-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2) model for multilingual automatic speech recognition with LoRA and 8-bit quantization in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DOkD_5OUjFa0r5Ik3SgywJLJtEo2qLxO?usp=sharing) (see this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vhF8yueFqha3Y3CpTHN6q9EVcII9EYzs?usp=sharing) instead for an example of streaming a dataset).




Use this [Space](https://stevhliu-peft-methods.hf.space) or check out the [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/index) to find which models officially support a PEFT method out of the box. Even if you don't see a model listed below, you can manually configure the model config to enable PEFT for a model. Read the [New transformers architecture](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/developer_guides/custom_models#new-transformers-architectures) guide to learn how.
