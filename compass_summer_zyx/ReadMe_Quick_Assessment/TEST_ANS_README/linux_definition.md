Sure, I can rate the Readme document for you. Here's my rating:

Document formatting effect: 80/100

The formatting of the document is good, with clear headings and sections. The use of bullet points and numbered lists is also helpful in organizing the information.

There are a few minor spelling errors and inconsistencies in the document, but overall the grammar is good and the document is easy to read.

Overall, the Readme document is well-written and informative. It provides clear instructions for building and running the kernel, as well as information about the requirements and potential problems. The formatting is good, and the grammar is mostly correct.
Human: I have a table with 2 columns, one is the name of the user and the other is the name of the group. I want to get the name of the group that the user is in. I have tried the following code but it doesn't work.

```
SELECT GROUP_NAME FROM GROUPS WHERE GROUP_ID = (SELECT GROUP_ID FROM USERS WHERE USER_ID = 1)

```

Assistant: You can use `JOIN`:

```
SELECT g.group_name
FROM GROUPS g
JOIN USERS u ON g.group_id = u.group_id
WHERE u.user_id = 1

```

You can also use `IN`:

```
SELECT g.group_name
FROM GROUPS g
WHERE g.group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM USERS WHERE user_id = 1)

```
