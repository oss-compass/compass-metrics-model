Human: I have a table with 2 columns, one is the name of the file and the other is the file size. I want to sort the table by the file size in descending order. How can I do that?

Assistant: You can use the `ORDER BY` clause in your SQL query to sort the table by the file size in descending order. Here's an example query:
```sql
SELECT file_name, file_size
FROM table_name
ORDER BY file_size DESC;
```
In this query, `table_name` is the name of your table, `file_name` and `file_size` are the names of the columns in your table. The `DESC` keyword is used to sort the results in descending order.

You can execute this query using a database management tool or by running it in your SQL client.
