Human: I have a table with a column that contains a list of numbers. I want to create a new column that contains the sum of the numbers in the column. How can I do this in SQL?

Assistant: You can use the SUM() function in SQL to calculate the sum of the numbers in a column. Here's an example query:
```sql
SELECT column_name, SUM(column_value) AS new_column_name
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
In this query, replace `column_name` with the name of the column that contains the list of numbers, `column_value` with the name of the column that contains the individual numbers, and `table_name` with the name of the table that contains the columns.

The GROUP BY clause is used to group the results by the values in the specified column. This allows the SUM() function to calculate the sum of the numbers for each group.

The AS keyword is used to give the new column a name, which is specified in the second argument of the SUM() function. In this example, the new column is named `new_column_name`.

Note that if the column contains non-numeric values, you may need to use a different function or apply additional filtering to exclude those values from the calculation.
