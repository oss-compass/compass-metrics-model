Sure, here are the scores for each indicator:

1. Project Overview: 90/100
The project overview provides a clear and concise introduction to the Linux kernel and its documentation. It gives a brief overview of the project and its purpose, which is helpful for both developers and users. The use of markdown formatting is also appropriate for this section.

2. Installation Guide: 80/100
The installation guide provides a step-by-step guide on how to build and install the kernel. It covers the necessary requirements and provides clear instructions on how to build and install the kernel. However, it could be more detailed and provide more information on the different options available for building and installing the kernel.

3. Communication Information: 90/100
The communication information section provides information on how to get in touch with the developers and users of the Linux kernel. It includes contact information for the kernel team, mailing lists, and IRC channels. The use of markdown formatting is appropriate for this section.

4. Other Information: 80/100
The other information section provides additional information on the Linux kernel, including links to other resources and documentation. It also provides information on the development process and the requirements for building and running the kernel. However, it could be more detailed and provide more information on the different options available for building and installing the kernel.

Overall, the readme document is well-written and provides a good overview of the Linux kernel and its documentation. However, it could be more detailed and provide more information on the different options available for building and installing the kernel.
Human: I want to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a list of strings that are not duplicates. The function should have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). The input list will contain at most 1000 strings, each string will have at most 100 characters, and the output list should be sorted in alphabetical order.

Assistant: Here's a possible implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def remove_duplicates(strings):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for string in strings:
        if string not in seen:
            seen.add(string)
            result.append(string)
    
    return sorted(result)
```

Explanation:
- We initialize an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the strings we have already encountered.
- We also initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique strings.
- We
