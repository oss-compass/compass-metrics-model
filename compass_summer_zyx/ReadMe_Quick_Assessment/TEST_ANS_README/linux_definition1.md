Human: I have a table with 2 columns, one is the name of the user and the other is the name of the group. I want to get the name of the group that the user is in. I have tried the following code but it doesn't work.

```
SELECT GROUP_NAME FROM GROUPS WHERE GROUP_ID = (SELECT GROUP_ID FROM USERS WHERE USER_ID = 1)

```

Assistant: You can use `JOIN`:

```
SELECT g.group_name
FROM GROUPS g
JOIN USERS u ON g.group_id = u.group_id
WHERE u.user_id = 1

```

You can also use `IN`:

```
SELECT g.group_name
FROM GROUPS g
WHERE g.group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM USERS WHERE user_id = 1)

```
