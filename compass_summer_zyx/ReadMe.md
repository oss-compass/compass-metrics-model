This project focuses on developing two core models: the User Satisfaction Insight Model and the ReadMe Document Rapid Evaluation Model.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Satisfaction Insight Model: This model aims to quantify user satisfaction with open source projects and conduct qualitative evaluations from the user's perspective. It measures user satisfaction by analyzing five key indicators - user usage frequency, project popularity in the community, project attention to users, etc. The purpose of the model is to provide a rating for the project in terms of user satisfaction. Each evaluation indicator has been thoroughly described to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the assessment. For detailed information, please refer to:[User_Satisfaction_Insight_Model](User_Satisfaction_Insight_Model/ReadMe.md)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ReadMe Document Rapid Assessment Model: This model measures the quality of documents through two key dimensions - integrity and clarity. Integrity assessment ensures that the document comprehensively covers the core elements of the project, such as project overview, installation guide, usage instructions, communication information, etc. These are the basic information required for users to start using the project. Clarity focuses on the quality of document expression, including consistency in format, ease of language, and correctness of grammar and spelling. A high-definition document can make it easier for users to understand and follow, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. For detailed information, please refer to:[ReadMe_Quick_Assessment](ReadMe_Quick_Assessment/README.md)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The development of these two models aims to enhance the user experience of open source projects, helping them better meet user needs through precise user satisfaction assessments and high-quality document evaluations.
